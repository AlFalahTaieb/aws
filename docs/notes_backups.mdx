1. Automated backups
    - On by default with a 7-day retention period
    - They can go back to any point in time up to 35 days (retention period)
    - Transaction logs are backed-by RDS every 5 minutes
    - This will take a full daily snapshot and will also store any transaction logs throughout the day
    - When you do a recovery, AWS will first choose the most recent daily backup, and then apply transaction logs relevant to that day
    - This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second, within the retention period
    - Automated backups are taken by default. The backup data is stored in S3 and you get free storage space equal to the size of your database.
    - Backups are taken within a defined window during which the users might expect a latency
    - Any changes to backup window take place immediately
2. Database snapshots
    - They are done manually and are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance
    - Retention of backup as per user
