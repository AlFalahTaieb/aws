## I. CloudTrail

1. CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording actions taken on your account.
2. Provides governance, compliance and **audit** for your AWS account.
3. <Quote>Enabled by default for all customers, can send logs to CloudWatch.</Quote>
4. Get a history of events i.e. API calls made within your AWS account by console, CLI, SDK, AWS services
5. **By default, event logs are encrypted using SSE-S3.**
6. Logs are published every 5 minutes.
7. If a resource is deleted, look into CloudTrail first!
8. Does not charge for your first management trail, but only the additional trails you that you create thereafter.
9. A trail can be applied to all regions or a single region. As a best practice, create a trail that applies to all regions in the AWS partition in which you are working. This is the default setting when you create a trail in the CloudTrail console.
10. Once you apply a trail in all regions, **CloudTrail will create a new trail in all regions by replicating the trail configuration**. CloudTrail will record and process the log files in each region and will deliver log files containing account activity across all AWS regions to a single S3 bucket and a single CloudWatch Logs log group.
11. <Quote>You can apply an existing trail to all regions. No need to create one tail per region!</Quote>
12. <Quote>A single KMS key can be used to encrypt log files for trails applied to all regions.</Quote>
13. **You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.** A trail that applies to all regions exists in each region and is counted as one trail in each region.
14. Typically, CloudTrail delivers an event within 15 minutes of the API call.
15. An event contains information about the associated activity: who made the request, the services used, the actions performed, and parameters for the action, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.
16. <Quote>You can configure one S3 bucket as the destination for multiple accounts.</Quote>
17. <Quote>AWS CloudTrail Insights events help customers identify unusual activity</Quote> in their AWS accounts such as spikes in resource provisioning, bursts of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions, or gaps in periodic maintenance activity.
18. <Quote>CloudTrail log file integrity validation feature allows you to determine whether a CloudTrail log file was unchanged, deleted, or modified since CloudTrail delivered it to the specified Amazon S3 bucket.</Quote>
19. Data events provide visibility into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as **data plane** operations. Data events are often high-volume activities.
    1. Not logged by default
    2. <Quote>S3 object-level API activity (e.g., GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject).</Quote>
    3. AWS Lambda function execution activity (the `Invoke` API).

20. Management events provide visibility into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as **control plane** operations. Example management events include:
    1. Logged by default
    2. <Quote>Configuring security (e.g. IAM AttachRolePolicy API operations)</Quote>
    3. <Quote>Registering devices (e.g. Amazon EC2 CreateDefaultVpc API operations)</Quote>

## II. AWS Config

1. Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources.
2. Helps record configurations and changes over time.
3. <Quote>Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena).</Quote>
4. AWS Config helps in
    1. Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
    2. Do my buckets have any public access?
    3. How has my ALB configurations changed over time?
    4. Is the AMI approved?

5. You can receive SNS alerts for your changes.
6. Can use AWS managed rules (75+ available)
7. Can make custom config rules (must be defined in AWS Lambda)
    1. evaluate if each EBS disk is GP2 type
    2. evaluate if each EC2 instance is t2.micro

8. Rules can evaluated or triggered
    1. for each config change
    2. at regular time intervals
    3. can trigger CloudWatch events if the rule is non-compliant (and daisy-chain with lambda)

9. Rules can have auto-remediations i.e. if a resource is not compliant, you can trigger an auto remediation e.g. stop instances with non-approved tags.
10. AWS Config rules do not prevent actions from happening (there's no explicit deny)
11. No free tier. $2/active rule/region 

## III. CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config

1. **CloudWatch (Performance)**
    1. Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network etc) and dashboard
    2. Events and alerts
    3. Log aggregation and analysis

2. **CloudTrail (Audit)**
    1. Who did what?
    2. Record API calls made within your account by everyone
    3. Can define trails for specific resources
    4. Global service

3. **Config (Compliance)**
    1. Record configuration changes
    2. Evaluate resources against compliance rules
    3. Get timeline of changes and compliance
