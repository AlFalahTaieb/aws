1. Choosing the right database

   1. Read-heavy, write-heavy or balanced workload?
   2. Throughput needs? Will it change gradually or fluctuate in bursts?
   3. How much data to store and for how long? Will it grow? Average object size?
   4. How are they accessed?
   5. Data durability? Source of truth?
   6. Latency requirements? Concurrent users?
   7. Data model? Structured vs unstructured?
   8. Strong schema? Flexible schema? Reporting?
   9. License cost? Switch to cloud native?

2. RDBMS

   1. SQL and OLTP
   2. RDS, Aurora (great for joins)
   3. Tabular and normalized data

3. NoSQL

   1. DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Neptune
   2. No joins

4. Object store

   1. S3 for big objects
   2. Glacier (for backup)

5. Data warehouse

   1. Redshift (OLAP)
   2. Athena

6. Search: ES for text and unstructured data
