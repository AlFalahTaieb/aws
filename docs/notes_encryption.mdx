## I. At-rest encryption

1. Possibility to encrypt the master and read replicas with KMS AES-256.
2. Encryption has to be defined at launch time.
3. If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted.
4. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server.

## II. In-flight encryption

1. SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight.
2. To enforce SSL:
    1. Pgsql: rds.force_ssl=l in the AWS RDS console
    2. MySQL: within the db, GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
    3. RDS enforces SSL by default

## III. Encrypting RDS backups

1. Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted.
2. Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted.
3. To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS instance,
    1. Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted one and enable encryption for the snapshot.
    2. Restore the db from the newly encrypted sanpshot.
    3. Move apps to the new encrypted db and delete the old one.

## IV. Security

1. RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one.
2. RDS security works by leveraging security groups (same as EC2) and control which IP/SG can talk to it.
3. IAM policies control who can manage AWS RDS (through RDS API).
4. You can use traditional username/password or IAM-based auth to login your db. The latter only works for MySQL and Pgsql.
    1. Need a token using RDS call.
    2. It has a lifetime of 15 minutes.
