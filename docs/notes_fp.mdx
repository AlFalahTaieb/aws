## General guiding principles

1. Stop guessing your capacity needs
2. Test systems at production scale
3. Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
4. Allow for evolutionary architectures (changing requirements)
5. Drive architectures using data
6. Improve through game days e.g. simulate apps for flash sale days

## I. Operational Excellence

1. Includes the ability to run and monitor systems and deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. 
2. Design principles
    1. Perform operations as a code (IaaS)
    2. Annotate docs (Auto docs after every build)
    3. Make frequent, small, reversible changes (push small and frequently)
    4. Refine operations procedures frequently
    5. Anticipate failure
    6. Learn from all operational failures

3. AWS operational excellence
    1. Prepare — CloudFormation, Config
    2. Operate — CloudFormation, Config, CloudTrail, CoudWatch, X-Ray
    3. Evolve — CloudFormation, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy

## II. Security

1. Includes the ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business values through risk assessment and mitigation strategies. 
2. Design principles
    1. Implement a strong identity foundation
    2. Enable traceability
    3. Apply security at all layers (edge, subnet, ALB, VPC)
    4. Automate security best practices
    5. Protect data in transit and at rest
    6. Keep people away from data
    7. Prepare for security events

3. AWS services
    1. IAM — IAM, STS, Orgs
    2. Detective controls — Config, CloudTrail, CloudWatch
    3. Infra — CloudFront, VPC, WAF, Shield, Inspector
    4. Data protection — KMS, S3, ELB
    5. Incident response — IAM, CloudFormation

## III. Reliability

1. Ability to recover from infra or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions, transient network issues.
2. Design principles
    1. Test recovery procedure (simulate failure scenarios)
    2. Automatically recover from failure
    3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
    4. Stop guessing capacity (never under-provision)
    5. Manage change in automation

3. AWS
    1. Foundations — IAM, VPC, Service Limits, Trusted Advisor
    2. Change Management — Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, CLoudTrail, Config
    3. Failure Management — Backups, CloudFormation, S3, Glacier, Route 53

## IV. Performance Efficiency

1. Includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolve.
2. Design principles
    1. Democratize advanced technologies
    2. Go global in minutes
    3. Use serverless as much as you can
    4. Experiment more often
    5. Mechanical sympathy (be on top of AWS services)

3. AWS services
    1. Selection (ASG, Lambda, EBS, S3, RDS)
    2. Review (CloudFormation, AWS news blog)
    3. Monitoring (CloudWatch)
    4. Tradeoffs (RDS vs Aurora, S3 vs Glacier, Aurora vs ElastiCache)

## V. Cost optimization

1. Run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
2. Design principles
    1. Adopt a consumption mode (pay per use)
    2. Measure overall efficiency
    3. Stop spending on data center operations
    4. Analyze and attribute expenses e.g. use tags
    5. Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership

3. AWS services
    1. Expenditure awareness — AWS budgets, Cost and usage report, Cost explorer
    2. Cost-effective resources — Spot vs Reserved vs Glacier
    3. Matching supply and demand —  ASG
    4. Optimize over time — Trusted Advisor
