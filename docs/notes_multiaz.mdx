1. Multi AZ allows you to have an exact copy of your production database in another Availability Zone.
2. It is active-passive
3. AWS handles the replication for you, so when your production database is written to, it's automatically synced with the standby (same DNS name).
4. In the case of failure/maintenance, RDS would automatically switch to the standby without admin intervention in case of following events:
    1. AZ outage
    2. Primary DB instance fails
    3. DB instance server type is changed
    4. OS is going through patching
    5. Manual failover was initiated

5. Its main objective is disaster-recovery than performance improvements, for which you'd need read-replicas.
6. Read replicas can be set as multi-AZ. Aurora has Multi-AZ in-built by default.
7. **Multi-AZ cannot serve read requests, they are not meant to be used as read replicas. They are only meant to be used as stand-by (except Aurora which can be both multi-AZ and read replica at the same time).**
8. Failover is automatically handled by RDS and it will flip the CNAME record to point to the standby instead.
9. You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. Amazon RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ DB instance.
