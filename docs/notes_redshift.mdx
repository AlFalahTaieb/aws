## I. Introduction

1. <Quote>Fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehousing solution (OLAP) for BI</Quote>
2. Based on pgsql, 10x better performance
3. Customers can start at $0.25/hr with no commitment
4. Two configurations
    - <Quote>Single-node</Quote> (160 GB)
    - <Quote>Multi-node</Quote>
        - Leader node (manages client connections and receives query)
        - Compute node (store data and perform queries, up to 128 nodes)
5. <Quote>Uses column-based storage and compression</Quote>
6. Doesn't require indexing so uses less space than traditional solutions
7. Comes with Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) and distributes data/query load across all nodes enabling fast query performance
8. Default backup with 1-day retention period (max 35)
9. Redshift always attempts to keep at least three copies of the data
    - Original
    - Replica
    - S3 backup (async, for disaster recovery)
10. Priced based on compute node-hours i.e. 1 unit per node per hour, backup and data transfer (within VPC)
11. Always encrypted with AES-256
12. Multi-AZ is NOT supported
13. Data can be loaded from S3, DynamoDB, DMS, other services
14. Supports all popular open data formats (Avro, Parquet, ORC etc)

## II. Redshift spectrum

1. <Quote>Query data that is already in S3 without loading it.</Quote>
2. To use it, you must have Redshift cluster to start the query.
3. The query is then submitted to thousands of Redshift spectrum nodes.
4. Does not use enhanced VPC routing.

## III. Redshift for SA

1. Operations: Similar to RDS
2. Security: IAM, VPC, KMS, SSL
3. Reliability: HA, auto-healing features
4. Performance: 10x better than other DW
5. Cost: pay per node provisioned, 1/10 cost of other DW

## IV. Redshift Tips

1. Redshift is a columnar data warehouse DB that is ideal for running long complex queries. 
2. <Quote>Redshift can also improve performance for repeat queries by caching the result and returning the cached result when queries are re-run. Dashboard, visualization, and business intelligence (BI) tools that execute repeat queries see a significant boost in performance due to result caching.</Quote>
3. When you use <Quote>Amazon Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing</Quote>, Amazon Redshift forces all `COPY` and `UNLOAD` traffic between your cluster and your data repositories through your Amazon VPC.
4. Two types of snapshots â€” automated and manual. Snapshots are stored in S3 using SSL, free of charge. After you reach the free limit, you are charged at regular S3 rate.
5. Redshift periodically takes incremental snapshots of your data every 8 hours or 5GB per node of data change.
6. <Quote>Automated snapshots are enabled by default when you create a cluster</Quote>. These snapshots are deleted at the end of a retention period, which is 1 day by default (can be modified). You cannot delete an automated snapshot manually.
7. Snapshots created from encrypted cluster are also encrypted.
8. By default, manual snapshots are retained indefinitely, even after you delete your cluster.
9. By default, a Redshift cluster is only accessible by the creator.
10. Based on the Redshift platform (EC2-classic, EC2-VPC), you must use the appropriate security group.
11. You pay a per-second billing rate based on the type and number of nodes in your cluster.
12. <Quote>You can reserve instances to save costs.</Quote>
13. You can use Workload Management (WLM) in the parameter group configuration.
14. AQUA is a new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache that enables Redshift to run up to 10x faster than any other cloud data warehouse.
15. <Quote>You can configure Amazon Redshift to copy snapshots for a cluster to another region.</Quote>
