## Creating a VPC

Step-by-step instructions on creating a VPC.

### Step 1: Create a VPC

### Step 2: Add subnets

Two public and two private subnets across two AZs.

### Step 3: Create EC2 and attach VPC to it

Make sure to enable auto assign IPs for each public subnet before attaching them to EC2.

### Step 4: Create route table and associate it to subnet

One each for public and private

**Edit route for public route table to associate any request from 0.0.0.0 to igw**

Now you should be able to connect to the EC2 instance through SSH. 

The public subnet is now also the **bastion host**.

### Step 5: Allow HTTP access with NACL

Edit security group of EC2 (launch-wizard-xyz) to allow HTTP on port 80.

```bash
# Sample Apache server
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
echo "hello world" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

This will display the page on EC2 URL.

You can then explicitly deny it by setting a new inbound rule in NACL of the VPC.

1. Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule. As soon as a rule matches traffic, it's applied immediately regardless of any higher-numbered rule that may contradict it.
2. In the above example, Rule 80 will be evaluated and then won't go further to Rule 100 or the default rule (*).
